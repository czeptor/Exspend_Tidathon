## Motivation
Fast enabling digital payments have led to overspending. India faces this issue critically because UPI has revolutionized the way India pays. People around the country face this problem, and no concrete solution exists yet. Hence, we are building a product around budgeting and deep expense tracking to save money and improve financial management.

We tried to understand the psychology behind this behavior and found an interesting inference. When people see their money depleting, they control their expenditures. Our idea is to automate tracking online payments made through multiple sources like UPI or Cards and nudge the user with the same guilt they experience while using cash. It will be further enhanced by directly enabling the reading of card payments on digital applications, such as e-commerce, food delivery, social media, etc., into the app. This solution is supposed to work as manual expense tracking is very tedious and people lose motivation over time. Hence, automated tracking and limiting expenses are the solutions for these users.
